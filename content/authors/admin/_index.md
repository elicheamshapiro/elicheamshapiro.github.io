## About Me

I am a Cambodian-American MRes candidate in Economics at Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) and will graduate in June 2025. I received my BA in economics from Bard College in May 2023. In the Fall of 2025, I will be joining the Department of Economics at Trinity College Dublin as a Predoctoral Research Assistant.
